START program  

1. ask user to enter the name of the input txt file  
   - check if it has `.txt` at the end
   - if not, warn em 
   - try to open the file in read mode  
   - if it's all good, read ALL the contents into a variable called `textyy`, or like a list or parapgraph or whatever fits

2. define function to count words  
   - split the text by spaces (or tabs/newlines etc)  
   - keep a count of actual word-looking things
   - return that count

3. make a function to count chars (yes, even spaces)  
   - just loop and count OR use len()

4. count spaces  
   - loop through each char  
   - if it's ' ', add to counter

5. commas?  
   - if char == ',' - boom, count++

6. same for periods  
   - look for '.' and count those too

7. for sentence counting:  
   - count '.', '?' and '!' as sentence enders  
   - might not be 100% accurate but works ok for basic text

8. vowels time  
   - loop through all chars  
   - if char is a, e, i, o, u (also their CAPS versions) - count it  

9. digits counting  
   - if char is a number (0–9), count it  
   - isdigit() could help but u can check manually too  

10. count UPPERCASE letters  
    - if 'A' <= char <= 'Z' - count++ 

11. count lowercase too  
    - same thing but 'a' to 'z'  

12. now special characters
    - loop through every char  
    - if it’s NOT a letter, digit, space, tab, newline, or regular punc  
      - count it as special  
      - maybe collect them in a set for listing later  

13. store all results somewhere, like a dict or separate vars  

14. print results to the terminal if needed (make it readable tho)  
    - use f-strings or just string concat if fancy  
    - include all counts, maybe in bulleted or labeled style

15. also open a new file called output.txt  
    - write the same report there too  
    - so it’s saved somewhere, not just in console  

16. finally, close both files (if not already auto-closed)

END program  


I mean above is basic outline, we r not allowed to use built in funcs, so we will use unicodes now simply.
